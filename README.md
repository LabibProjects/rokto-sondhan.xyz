**Rokto Sondhan** is a life-saving platform designed to help people find nearby blood donors in Bangladesh. Hospitals often face blood shortages, and even when blood is available, it's not always fresh. This website provides a quick and reliable solution for finding blood donors, especially in emergencies.

## Key Features

### 1. Quick Blood Search
In emergency situations, time is critical. **Rokto Sondhan** helps you find blood donors quickly, ensuring you get the help you need as fast as possible.

### 2. Fresh Blood Supply
Unlike blood from blood banks, which may not always be fresh, this platform connects you directly with donors, ensuring fresher and more effective blood for patients.

### 3. Easy to Use
The website is designed to be user-friendly. Simply share your location, and in just a few seconds, you'll get a list of potential blood donors near you.

### 4. Support for Student Movements
In these challenging times of student movements, many students are losing their lives due to severe blood loss. Your donation could be the difference between life and death for these young people.

##Conclution
Due to security concerns, as this website currently (as of August 11, 2024) contains a substantial amount of donor data, we are committed to maintaining their privacy. Therefore, we are not sharing any source files at this time.

Additionally, starting in mid-July 2024, there was a tragic mass killing of students in Bangladesh. Although the situation has improved, there was a significant blood shortage during that period. As a result, this website was developed in just 24 hours and launched on July 30, 2024.
